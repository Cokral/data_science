    "\"Probability theory is a mathematical framework for **representing uncertain statements**. It provides a means of **quantifying uncertainty** as well as axioms for deriving new uncertain statements. In Artificial Intelligence, we use probability theory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems should reason, so we design our algorithms to **compute or approximate various expressions** derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and statistics to theoretically **analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems**.\""
