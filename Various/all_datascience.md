## Glossary

 - **Bias**:

"Bias measures how well a trained (on training dataset) algorithm can generalize on unseen data. High bias (underfitting) meaning the model cannot work well on unseen data." [1](##References)

 - **Variance**:

"Variance measures the sensitivity of the model to changes in the dataset. High variance is the overfitting." [1](##References)
